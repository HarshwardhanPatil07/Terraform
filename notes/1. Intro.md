# What is Terraform

- Automate and manage your infrastructure
- Your Platform
- And services that run on that platform
- Open Source and Declarative= define WHAT end result you want
- **Tool for creating and configuring infrastruture.**
- Use just 1 tool to integrate all those different technologies.

## There are two main steps
1. Provisioning Infrastructure (Terraform)
2. Deploying Applications

1. Provisioning Infra?? (All needs to be done in correct order)
- create VPC
- spin up servers
- create AWS users and permissions 
- install docker

# Difference between Ansible and Terraform
- Both automate: Provisioning, configuring and managing the infrastructure
![Ansible-and-terraform-difference](/assets/Ansible-and-terraform-difference.png)
- Ansible - better for configuring infra
- Terraform - better for provisioning infra
- Managing Existing Infra
- Replicating Infra 
# Architecture
## How does Terraform connect to the platform provider like AWS??
- 2 Main Components
1. CORE
- *2 input sources*
- *TF-CONFIG* - What to create/configure?
- *State* - current state of setup 
## What core does is take this input and figures out plan of what needs to be done. It compares the state, what is current state and configuration you desire and compares that, figures out what needs to be done to get to desired state, ***Plans: What needs to be created/updated/deleted***
2. Execute the plan with *Providers*

# Example configuration file

|:--:|:--:|
| Config File Example 1 | Config File Example 2 |

# Declarative meaning 
- *You define the end state in config file:*
- 5 servers with following network config
- AWS user with following permissions
