# Security Group
- We want to open the port to allow access so we will configure security group
- incoming traffic - ssh into EC2, access from the browser; so we configure ingress for incomming traffic   

- Get Ip Address from https://www.whatsmyip.org/

- outgoing traffic - installations, fetch docker image; suppose we have nginx so the image needs to be fetched from browser right, we use egress
