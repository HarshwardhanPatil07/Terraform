- NACL - subnet level (open by default)
- Security group - server level (closed by default)

# Security Group
- We want to open the port to allow access so we will configure security group
- incoming traffic - ssh into EC2, access from the browser; so we configure ingress for incomming traffic   

- Get Ip Address from https://www.whatsmyip.org/

- outgoing traffic - installations, fetch docker image; suppose we have nginx so the image needs to be fetched from browser right, we use egress

# Automate SSH Key Pair
- Previously used is manually created key-pair 
- Use cmd `ssh-keygen`
- id_rsa.pub is needed
- get the value by `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` # Do not check this in git repo

## If you need particular attribute of ec2 instance then run `terraform state show aws_instance.myapp-server` 
# since we have public and private key to ssh into server use `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ec2-user@<public_ip>`

# IaC benefits 
- you may forget to clean up resources but terraform does it
- Environment replication for development, staging 
- in manual you need to document the stuff. Knowledge sharing difficult manually 

# Added user script so don't need to ssh manually

# Provisioners
- "remote-exec" Provisioner -> invokes script on a remote resource after it is created -- inline- list of commands
- "file" Provisioner -> copy files or directories from local to newly created resource -- source - source file or folder -- destination - absolute path
- "local-exec" provisioner -> invokes a local executable after a resource is created. -- locally, Not on the created resource!

# Provisioners are not recommended in TF
- Use user_data if availabe
- Breaks idempotency concept # An operation is idempotent if performing it once has the same effect as performing it multiple times.
- TF dosen't know what you execute
- Breaks current-desired state comparison
## Recommendations alternate
## alternative to remote-exec 
- use configuration management tools
- once server provisioned, hand over to those tools
## alternative to local-exec 
- use "local" provider
