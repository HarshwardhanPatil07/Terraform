## default = one NAT gateway per subnet
- `single_nat_gateway = true` All private subnets will route their traffic through this single NAT gateway
- `enable_dns_hostnames = true` it adds public and private dns names

- tags in vpc.tf are for ccm(Cloud-controller-manager)

- whenever create module do `terraform init` because new module is added by Provision Instructions.
- private subnets are for our workloads and public subnets are for external resources like loadbalancer.

# Different team members and different states for each member
- Each user server must make sure they always have the latest state data before running terraform.
- How to share the same terraform state file?? -> Remote Terraform State.
## Configure remote storage 
```bash
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 0.12"
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "myapp-tf-s3-bucket"
    key = "myapp/state.tfstate"
    region = "ap-south-1"
  }
}
```

# Terraform best Practices
1. Manipulate state only through TF commands (terraform apply, terraform state) (do not edit manually)
2. Always set up a shared remote storage (so the team knows)
3. Concurrent changes?? Lock state file until working of state file is completed (DynamoDB is used for automatic state file locking)
4. Losing state file?? Backup by versioning 
5. Use 1 state per environment (Dev, Test, Prod) 
6. GitOps version control of terraform code on repository using git
7. Treat TF code just like your application code(CI for terraform code)(meaning have branches for junior dev to make changes and then test build and then merge to main branch)
8. Apply terraform commands ONLY through CD Pipeline.


Yay! IaC Completed!
